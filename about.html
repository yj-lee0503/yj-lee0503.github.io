        <p>I initially studied Mathematics at the University of Virginia because I did not know the path I want to take
            in my future. I thought Mathematics is one of the best ways to prepare myself to handle any future
            challenges. I was fortunate to have my first job at the big data company, which became the field I am truly
            fascinated about. Then I had great opportunities and experience as a data analyst, BI developer, and data
            engineer.</p>
        <p>
            With this passion, I finished my graduate certificate degree in Data Science at George Mason University. I
            am in Masters in Computer and Information Technology program at the University of Pennsylvania.</p>
        <p>
            On the personal side, I was born in Seoul, South Korea. I came to the United States with my family back in
            2004.
