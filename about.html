                    I am a passionate problem-solver who enjoys new challenges and learning new skills to take given challenges. 
                    I have been in love with my work in data and insights from various data. 
                </p>

                    I initially studied Mathematics at the University of Virginia because I did not know the path I want to take in my future. 
                    I only knew I like to take on various challenges and love to solve problems. I thought studying Mathematics will prepare me to approach different situations and challenges in the future. 
                    Then, I was fortunate to have my first job at a big data company, which made me realize my passion for data. I had great opportunities and experience as a data analyst, BI developer,  and data engineer.

                <p>
                    With this passion, I finished my graduate certificate degree in Data Science at George Mason University.
                    I am in Masters in Computer and Information Technology program at the University of Pennsylvania. I enjoy learning new things every day. 
                    My goal is to support more people with their data needs.
